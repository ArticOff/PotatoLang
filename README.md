My programming language

## Quick Examples

Say "hello world":
```cs
printf("hello world")

```

Do a variable and print it:
```cs
declare myVar = "how are you?"

printf(myVar)

>>> how are you ?
```

Ask a question and print the response:
```cs
declare name = inputf("What's ur name ?\nYou: ")

printf("Hi [name] !")

>>> What's ur name ?
>>> You: Artic
>>> Hi Artic !
```
