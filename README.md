# PotatoLang

My programming language

### It's just for fun, I don't intend to continue making it a real language

## Quick Examples

Say "hello world":
```cs
print("hello world");

>>> hello world
```

Do a variable and print it:
```cs
myVar = "how are you?";

print($myVar);

>>> how are you ?
```

## How to install it ?

1. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (I recommend a recent version of Python)
2. [Download all files](https://github.com/ArticOff/potatoLang/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
3. Put them in a common folder
4. Open a terminal
5. Type "python potato.py example/hello_world.potato"
6. You're done !

## Syntax

### In the syntax of my language, there are semicolons at the end of each variable, or function 

```cs
myVar = "how are you?";

print($myVar);

>>> how are you ?
```

If you forget one of the semicolons, an error occurs.

```cs
myVar = "how are you?";

print($myVar)

>>> SyntaxError: Missing semicolons in line 3
```

### To increment a variable in a print function, you must use the dollar sign

```cs
myVar = "how are you?";

print($myVar);

>>> how are you ?
```

Otherwise, an error occurs

```cs
myVar = "how are you?";

print(myVar);

>>> SyntaxError: Missing dollar sign in line 3
```

That's all
